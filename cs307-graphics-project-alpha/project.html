        <p class="lead text-muted">
          For my final project, I created an animated scene, similar to the one where Mike and Sulley are stuck
          and chased in the door warehouse, where they are riding and hopping between doors that are moving. In my
          scene, I don't have Sulley, but I have Mike attached to a door, screaming as the door rides down the helix.

          <br>
          My goals for the scene were to use the following concepts we learned in class:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">&bull; Realistic Modeling of Mike</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">&bull; Realistic Modeling of the Classic Monsters Inc. Door</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">&bull; Incorporate Material, Lighting and Shading</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">&bull; Have Camera Position Move during Animation</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">&bull; Create Challenging Curved Lines and Surfaces</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">&bull; Incorporate Textures and texture-mapping</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">&bull; Animation with Ability of User Interaction for the Moving Door and Screaming Mike</li>

          <p>Initially, when I had made Mike, I just wanted to get his general shape, color and eye down, so that
          it would be distinguisable who I was trying to model after. For the final project, I wanted to be more
          precise in his features and create the necessary curves and shapes to make his body parts more defined,
          especially when it came to his mouth, limbs, horns and even head shape, as well as the placement of the features.</p>

        material.</p>
